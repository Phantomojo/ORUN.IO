Introduction: The Climate-Energy Nexus in Africa
The climate-energy nexus represents the critical intersection of climate change and
the energy sector, a relationship that is particularly pronounced in Africa. This

--- PAGE 1 ---

nexus acknowledges that our energy systems are a primary driver of climate
change, while climate change, in turn, creates significant risks for our energy
systems. For Africa, a continent with the lowest historical carbon emissions but the
highest vulnerability to climate impacts, navigating this nexus is not just an
environmental issue—it is a fundamental challenge for sustainable development,
economic growth, and human well-being. With over 600 million people lacking
access to electricity, the continent faces the dual challenge of expanding energy
access while simultaneously transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient
development pathway. This whitepaper explores the complexities of this challenge
and presents the CHAI Pan-African Hackathon as a key platform for fostering the
innovative solutions needed to unlock a sustainable and prosperous future for all
Africans.
Africa's Climate Change Challenge
Africa is at the epicenter of the global climate crisis. Despite contributing a mere
2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the continent bears a disproportionately
heavy burden from the impacts of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified Africa as the world's most vulnerable
continent, a vulnerability that stems from a combination of factors including its
high dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and limited adaptive
capacity. The consequences of this vulnerability are already being felt across the
continent, with far-reaching implications for ecosystems, economies, and
communities.
The year 2023 alone witnessed a devastating array of extreme weather events
across Africa. Deadly heatwaves scorched communities, while torrential rains and
floods displaced thousands and destroyed critical infrastructure. Tropical cyclones
battered coastal regions, and prolonged droughts led to widespread food and
water shortages. These events are not isolated incidents but rather a glimpse into

--- PAGE 2 ---

the escalating reality of a warming planet. The World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) has warned that extreme weather and climate change are impacting every
aspect of socio-economic development in Africa, exacerbating existing challenges
such as hunger, insecurity, and displacement.
The impacts of climate change are not uniform across the continent, with different
regions facing unique challenges. In some areas, severe and long-term droughts
are leading to crop failures and famine, while others are grappling with intense
rainfall, sea-level rise, and both coastal and riparian flooding. Urban areas, which
are rapidly expanding across the continent, face their own set of vulnerabilities,
including increased risks from flooding, heat stress, and water scarcity.
The sectoral impacts of climate change are equally diverse and interconnected.
Agriculture, which employs over 60% of Africa's population, is particularly
vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Water security is under
threat as glaciers recede, rivers dry up, and rainfall becomes more erratic. This, in
turn, affects food security, with millions facing the risk of hunger and malnutrition.
The health of the population is also at risk, with an increased burden of
vector-borne diseases, heat-related illnesses, and respiratory problems due to dust
and air pollution. Coastal communities are on the frontlines of sea-level rise, facing
the threat of inundation, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.
Addressing Africa's climate change challenge requires a two-pronged approach:
ambitious mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bold
adaptation measures to build resilience to the impacts that are already locked in.
This will require significant investment, technological innovation, and a strong
commitment from both African governments and the international community.
The CHAI Pan-African Hackathon is a testament to the growing momentum for
climate action in Africa, providing a platform for the continent's brightest minds to

develop innovative solutions that can help build a more sustainable and resilient
future.
The Energy Paradox: Africa's Untapped Potential
Africa is a continent of paradoxes, and nowhere is this more evident than in the
energy sector. While the continent is endowed with vast and diverse energy
resources, it remains the most energy-deficient region in the world. Over 600
million Africans—nearly half the population—lack access to electricity, and almost
1 billion rely on traditional biomass for cooking, with severe consequences for
health, gender equality, and the environment. This energy poverty coexists with an
abundance of untapped renewable energy potential, including solar, wind,
geothermal, and hydropower. This paradox represents both a profound challenge
and an immense opportunity for the continent.
The numbers are stark. Africa is home to 75% of the world's population without
access to electricity. This lack of access to modern energy services stifles economic
growth, limits educational opportunities, and hampers the delivery of essential
services such as healthcare. The reliance on traditional biomass for cooking, such
as wood and charcoal, leads to indoor air pollution, which is responsible for
hundreds of thousands of premature deaths each year, disproportionately
affecting women and children. Furthermore, the unsustainable harvesting of wood
for fuel contributes to deforestation and land degradation, exacerbating the
impacts of climate change.
However, the narrative of Africa's energy future is not one of scarcity but of
opportunity. The continent is blessed with some of the best solar resources in the
world, with an estimated 10 terawatts of solar energy potential. The Great Rift
Valley holds vast geothermal potential, and the continent's major rivers offer
significant hydropower capacity. Wind energy is also a growing resource, with

--- PAGE 4 ---

promising potential in several regions. This abundance of renewable energy
resources provides Africa with a unique opportunity to leapfrog the fossil
fuel-based development models of the past and build a clean, sustainable, and
resilient energy system from the ground up.
The transition to a renewable energy-powered future is already underway. The cost
of renewable energy technologies, particularly solar, has fallen dramatically over
the past decade, making them increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Off-grid
and mini-grid solutions are emerging as a viable and cost-effective way to bring
electricity to remote and rural communities. Pay-as-you-go models are making
solar home systems affordable for low-income households. Countries like Kenya
and Nigeria are investing in renewable energy for healthcare facilities, and Ghana
is developing national climate and health strategies that recognize the importance
of clean energy.
Unlocking Africa's renewable energy potential will require a concerted effort from
governments, the private sector, and civil society. It will require significant
investment in grid infrastructure, supportive policies and regulations, and the
development of local capacity. It will also require innovative solutions that are
tailored to the unique needs and contexts of different African countries and
communities. The CHAI Pan-African Hackathon is designed to be a catalyst for this
innovation, bringing together the continent's brightest minds to develop the
solutions that will power Africa's sustainable future.
The CHAI Hackathon: A Call to Innovators
In response to the urgent and interconnected challenges of climate change and
energy access in Africa, the African Climate and Energy Nexus (CHAI) is proud to
launch the inaugural Pan-African Hackathon. This initiative is a call to action for the

and creative thinkers—to come together and build solutions for a more
sustainable and resilient future. The hackathon is designed to be a catalyst for
homegrown innovation, providing a platform for Africans to develop solutions for
Africa, reflecting the continent's diverse contexts and urgent sustainability needs.
The CHAI Hackathon is more than just a competition; it is a collaborative platform
for learning, networking, and creating impact. Participants will have the
opportunity to work with a diverse network of mentors, access cutting-edge tools
and resources, and develop solutions that have the potential to be scaled up and
